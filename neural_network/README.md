# neural_network
Implementation of conventional neural network, written in C++.  

A neural network is trained to to predict the number of high inputs as shown below:  

          inputs[2:0]    outputs[1:0]  
              000             00  
              001             01  
              010             01  
              011             10  
              100             01  
              101             10  
              110             10  
              111             11
